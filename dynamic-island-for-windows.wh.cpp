## 🚀 Modules & Dashboards

The Dynamic Island intelligently expands to display context-aware dashboards. You can easily navigate between different views using your mouse scroll wheel.

| Module | Description | Preview |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Media Player** | Shows live album art, track details, audio waveforms, and full playback controls. | ![Media](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devcode90/Dynamic-Island-for-Windows/793cf954d51aa9748c39d544187fab6e25ecd0fb/previews/media-v2.png) |

## ✨ Core Features

- **Hardware Privacy Indicators:** A pulsing orange dot appears when your microphone is active, and a green dot when your camera is in use. Rate-limited polling ensures absolutely no CPU drain.
- **High-Res Clipboard & Notifications:** Instantly see what you copied or your latest Windows notifications, featuring crisp, high-fidelity 64px app icons extracted directly from system executables.
- **360Hz+ Dynamic Fluid Animations:** Ultra-smooth resizing and splitting with native support for high refresh rate monitors (up to 360Hz/500Hz+) and zero idle CPU drain.
- **Eight Curated Themes:** Obsidian, Graphite, Slate, Nord, Evergreen, Espresso, Plum and a light Porcelain, all switchable from the right-click menu's Theme submenu — or dial in your exact hex colors.
- **Clean Flat Material:** Surfaces are built from soft downward depth shading, a drop shadow, and an accent wash tinted live from your album art. No rim lighting, no glass highlights, no outlined cards — nothing traces a bright line along an edge.
- **Real Blur & Acrylic Backdrop:** Optionally paint genuine Windows blur or frosted acrylic behind the island so your desktop shows through it, exactly like the system's own surfaces.
- **Translucent Backgrounds:** Hex colors accept an alpha channel (`#RRGGBBAA`), so you can make the island see-through while keeping text and icons perfectly crisp.
- **Your Language:** The island's own labels follow your Windows display language across 12 languages, or you can pick one explicitly.
- **File Tray:** Drag any file onto the island to park it on a shelf, then click to open it. You can now drag files back out into any folder or app, and remove them one by one. The island itself only references files, it never copies or moves them.
- **Lyrics on the Collapsed Island:** Switch on "Show lyrics on collapsed island" from the right-click menu and the pill widens to show the current line as it's sung, sliding in with every new line. When there are no synced lyrics it shows the song title instead.
- **Quick Lookup:** Press **Ctrl+Alt+Space** to open a search box right on the island. Type a word or phrase, press Enter, and get a definition or a short summary. Your clipboard text and recent searches are one click away.
- **Typography & Clock Control:** Scale all island text independently of the island's size, choose 12- or 24-hour time, show seconds, and set a custom date pattern — including CJK forms like `yyyy年MM月dd日`.

## ⚙️ Usage & Settings

- **Hover & Scroll:** Hover over the island to seamlessly expand it. Use your mouse scroll wheel to swipe between the Media, Calendar, Weather, Hardware Monitor, File Tray, and Lyrics tabs.
- **File Tray:** Enable the File Tray module, then drag files onto the island. It jumps to the shelf to confirm the drop. Click a row to open that file, drag a row out to drop the file into any folder or app, or press the small ✕ on a row to remove just that file. The bin button in the header clears the whole shelf.
- **Lyrics on the Collapsed Island:** Right-click the island and tick "Show lyrics on collapsed island". This choice is remembered across restarts. Long lines pan across as they are sung.
- **Cross-Source Media Switching:** If multiple apps are playing media at the same time, you can smoothly swap between their active playback controls directly from the island without opening the apps.
- **Quick Lookup:** Press the hotkey (default **Ctrl+Alt+Space**, changeable in the **Shortcuts** tab) to open the search box. Type a word or phrase and press Enter. Up/Down picks a row and Esc closes it. With an empty box it suggests your clipboard text and your recent lookups. Results come from Wiktionary and Wikipedia, with dictionaryapi.dev as a backup. Nothing is sent anywhere until you press Enter, and recent lookups are kept in memory only. Turn it off under Modules > "Quick Lookup (hotkey)".
- **Right-Click Menu:** Right-click the island to access Theme presets, Transparency settings, collapsed-island lyrics, and to pin the island open.
- **⚠️ Right-click choices are per-session:** The right-click menu is a quick way to try things out, not a place to configure the mod. **Theme**, **shape style** (Pill / Notch / Windows 11) and **pin open** are all re-applied from your Windhawk settings whenever the mod restarts — so a reboot, a mod update, or toggling the mod off and on will discard them. Anything you want to keep, set in the **Mod Settings** tab instead. (Transparency and Expand-on-hover do persist, but the settings tab is still the reliable place for them.)
- **Windhawk Settings:** Visit the Mod Settings tab to change the island's Position, Size Scale, Refresh Rate (Target FPS), Animation Style (Smooth/Default/Bouncy/Snappy), Animation Speed, and toggle specific modules. You can also perfectly align the island using the `Offset X` and `Offset Y` settings, and select exactly which monitor the island should appear on (including a "Follow Mouse" mode!).
- **Notifications:** Windows must allow apps to read notifications: turn on **Settings > Privacy & security > Notifications > "Let apps access your notifications"**. Without that permission Windows denies the listener and the module stays silent. Nothing needs to be added to the process inclusion list; the island runs in its own process and reads notifications from there.
- **Quick Hide/Show:** Right-click the island and choose "Hide Island" to collapse it completely — CPU usage drops to ~0% while hidden since the mod fully parks its render thread. Bring it back instantly with the configurable hotkey (default **Ctrl+Alt+D**, changeable in the **Shortcuts** settings tab). Because a hidden island can't be right-clicked, the hotkey is the *only* way back once hidden — if you turn the hotkey off while hidden, re-enable it (or disable the mod) from Windhawk's settings.

## 💾 Lyrics Cache

**Why it matters:** instant lyrics, less load on the free LRCLIB server, tiny disk footprint, and you can wipe it anytime.

- **Source:** lyrics come from [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net), a free open-source lyrics database.
- **Where:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DynamicIslandForWindows\lyrics`, one small file per song.
- **What's inside:** the song title, artist, album, duration and the lyric text. It stays on your own PC only. Nothing is uploaded anywhere.
- **Size & expiry:** capped at 25 MB by default (10 / 25 / 100 MB or Off in settings); the least recently used files are deleted first. Only songs that have lyrics are cached (refreshed after 90 days). Songs without lyrics, and failed requests, are never saved, so they are simply looked up again each time they play.
- **Turn it off:** Mod Settings > Modules > "Lyrics cache (disk)", or set the size limit to Off. Lyrics are then not read from or written to disk at all.
- **Clear it:** right-click the island > "Clear lyrics cache" (shows how many songs and how much space it uses).
- **By hand:** you can delete the folder at any time. It is not removed when the mod is uninstalled.
